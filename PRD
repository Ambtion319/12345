Product Name: UWorld replica
Prepared by: Bossx2
Date: [14/9/2025]
Version: 1.0
1. Overview
This platform enables students and professionals to practice exam-style questions in an environment modeled after UWORLD. Users can upload PDFs or Excel files containing question sets. The system applies OCR (if required), parses the content, and serves questions in a UWORLD-like interface with explanations and performance analytics. If explanations are missing, an LLM generates high-quality feedback aligned with exam standards.
2. Goals & Objectives
Provide a UWORLD-equivalent learning experience for uploaded/custom questions.
Automate question ingestion from PDFs and Excel spreadsheets.
Maintain content fidelity (questions, options, images, diagrams).
Ensure accurate OCR parsing for scanned PDFs.
Deliver immediate, structured feedback with fallback to LLM-based explanations.
Provide analytics and tracking of student performance over time.
3. Target Users
Medical students preparing for exams (e.g., USMLE, PLAB, licensing exams).
Educators who want to create private/custom question banks.
Institutions offering adaptive learning resources.
4. Key Features
4.1 Question Ingestion
File Upload: Accept PDF, Word, and Excel formats.
OCR Engine: Extract text/images from scanned PDFs. (Tesseract or AWS Textract)
Parser: Detects question, options, correct answer, and explanations.
Validation: User can preview and correct parsing errors before final import.
4.2 Question Interface (UWORLD Replica)
Layout:
Question text (rich text + images).
Answer options (radio buttons).
